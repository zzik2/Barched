Backporting Parched and Camel Husk to 1.21.1!
(**Spear is not backported in this mod!**)

This port is written similarly to Mojang code, with most of the code written in Mixins.
and namespace is ``minecraft:``. so even if you upgrade your Minecraft version, your entities will remain!

## TODO:
- backport spears...?
